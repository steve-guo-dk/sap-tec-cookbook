# SAP Technology Cookbook
This repository help people find the right blog, video, document when having problems during their SAP implementation. It will not document how to solve a problem but will provide link to the most relvant resource, it could be a youtube video, sap turorial, blog , or open sap course. The link to the resource will be accurate enough to make sure people don't need to spend a lot of time to check where the content is. In case it is a video longer than 20 minutes, there will be also note roughly mention where you can find it in the video.
# How the cookbook is build
The content in the cookbook is added based on my learnings, including both systematical learning and when I search resource to solve problems. I may be link to my artical but in most cases it will link to SAP's official learning resources. The link will be validate by me that it is the valide, and up to date solution if it is comming from non-official authors. 
# How do you use this
I suggest you use this cookbook as a index to check if it contains link to the content you need. And if you want to write a blog, you can also check the cookbook to see if it is already documented. But as I said this repository is majorly based on my learning journey and I don't have the ambition to become a No.1 knowledge base over the internet, there will be no commitment of the number of resources nor the speed of adding contents .
